# chatbotV2
The second version of my chatbot
# TODO:
Make a good name for the chatbot. Preferrably something to do with the idea that it will be able to admit what it does not know.

Make structure return something usefull for later sentence analysis (tuples of something to identify the structure by, and the things inside the structure) or raise an exception if nothing found.

Define a custom exception for the above (structureNotFoundError)

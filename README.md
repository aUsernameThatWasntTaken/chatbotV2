# chatbotV2
The second version of my chatbot
# TODO:
Make a good name for the chatbot. Preferrably something to do with the idea that it will be able to admit what it does not know.

Rename some of the functions to something more appropriate.

(Optional) Make the chatbot seem annoyed when the same sentence is input with the same output more than twice.

Make the chatbot remember information provided by the user

Make the chatbot capable of logical reasoning.
